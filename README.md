# EVE Carbon
Designed for serious capsuleers and industrial manufacturers, EVE-Carbon is a comprehensive desktop management tool for EVE Online. By integrating live ESI data with a local Static Data Export (SDE) database, it delivers lightning-fast recursive blueprint calculations, real-time wealth tracking, and integrated XMPP Jabber communications—all wrapped in a secure, customizable Electron interface. Whether you are scaling up capital ship production or optimizing regional supply chains, EVE-Carbon provides the critical data and organizational tools needed to dominate the industrial market.

## 🚀 Features

* **Secure EVE SSO Integration**: Authenticate characters securely via EVE Online SSO.
* **Blueprint Library Management**: Synchronize, browse, and organize your blueprints directly from ESI.
* **Recursive Material Calculator**: Dynamically build multi-level manufacturing trees for any blueprint, integrating public blueprint copies via Fuzzwork.
* **Asset & Wealth Tracking**: Track liquid wealth, active market orders, and item locations across your character roster.
* **Built-in Jabber Client**: Connect directly to `jabber.eveonline.com` via an integrated XMPP client with director-only filtering.
* **Local SDE Database**: Uses a local SQLite EVE Static Data Export (SDE) for lightning-fast, offline item and type lookups.
* **Dynamic Theming**: Customizable UI with user-configurable themes saved locally.

## 🏗 Architecture & Tech Stack

* **Framework**: [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) (Main and Renderer processes with Context Bridge isolation).
* **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, utilizing dynamic CSS variables for theming.
* **Backend / Local DB**: Node.js, `sqlite3` for local SDE queries, and local JSON storage for user profiles and caching.
* **External APIs**: 
  * EVE Online ESI (`https://esi.evetech.net`)
  * EVE SSO OAuth 2.0
  * Fuzzwork API
  * EVE Tech Image Server

## Building the .exe

### Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher (includes npm)

### Steps

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the Windows installer (.exe)**
   ```
   npm run build-win
   ```
   The installer will be in `dist/EVE Carbon Setup x.x.x.exe`

3. **Or just run it without building:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Other platforms
- **macOS:** `npm run build-mac`
- **Linux:** `npm run build-linux`

## No icon?
The build requires `assets/icon.ico` for Windows. If you don't have one, either:
- Remove the `"icon"` lines from `package.json`, or
- Drop any `.ico` file into the `assets/` folder and name it `icon.ico`

You can convert a PNG to ICO at https://convertio.co/png-ico/

## Notes
- All data comes from the public EVE ESI API — no API key or login needed
- Blueprint material data may be incomplete for very new items not yet indexed by ESI
- Reaction chains are auto-detected (manufacturing vs reaction blueprints)
